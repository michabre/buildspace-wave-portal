# BuildSpace Project: WavePortal

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## Commands

### Hardhat

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
```

### Testing

Solidity Coverage will display how much of the project is being
covered by the tests.

```shell
npx hardhat coverage
```

### Deployed to Rinkeby!

```shell
> npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
